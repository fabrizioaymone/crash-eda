# CRASH DATASET

The notebook analizes (i.e. mean, mode, skewness, etc) the [crash dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasannakm/car-crash-dataset?select=train-new.csv) and builds visual representation of the data using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Some curious insights

By analizing the correlation matrix, we can observe that the year of the vehicle and the deployment of the airbag are the features that are mostly correlated, that can be explained by the fact that older vehicles are usually technically obsolete and airbag deployment does not work correctly.
